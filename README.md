- 👋 Hi, I’m @dhensonroyall
- 👀 I mostly work in the Google Apps Script IDE, using APIs, spreadsheets, and BigQuery (SQL) to make automated reports.
- 🌱 I'm starting to dabble with HTML/CSS, true Javascript, and will be learning Python next.
- 💞️ I like to share projects that might help others solve annoying problems.
